# Kinemation vs Entities Graphics

Entities Graphics is one of the most advanced ECS packages Unity has ever
written. You can learn a lot about high-performance design from deep-diving into
the code. However, with a fresh perspective, there are also many opportunities
for improvement, especially with regards to skinned meshes. The table below
highlights many of the changes Kinemation makes to Entities Graphics in order to
achieve its top-class performance goals.

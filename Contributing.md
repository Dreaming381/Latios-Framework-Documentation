# Contributing

Oh hi! Awesome of you to stop by!

No. I don’t want your money. And no, I don’t drink coffee.

If you are an artist or someone who is dead-set on using disposable income to
make the Latios Framework better, jump to [here](#_Art).

Otherwise, I’m assuming you are here because you are a programmer and want to
contribute to an open source project the way programmers do. Keep reading to get
some ideas.

## Picking a Feature

If you are just looking to contribute some bug fixes, skip this step.

If you already have a feature in mind, be sure to run it by me via various
channels. The Discord server is usually the best (public or DMs) if you want
fast responses. But forum PMs, GitHub discussions, and email all work as well.

If you don’t have a feature in mind, worry not. There are plenty of open
challenges to solve. Not all of them require the brainpower of a super-genius
either. Convenience utilities, Editor tooling with UI Toolkit, and dev-ops are
all areas that could really use your help. And someone needs to make the example
projects.

If you a looking for an optimization challenge, there’s plenty around too, many
of which will have real impacts for lots of users.

You can find open tasks
[here](https://github.com/Dreaming381/Latios-Framework/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22open+to+contributors%22).
If you don’t see a task in an area that interests you, reach out via Discord,
forums, GitHub, or email to see if there are other items that may not be fully
defined yet.

## Developing Using a Public GitHub Account

If you would like to use git to develop a new feature, follow these steps:

1.  Fork the Latios Framework from GitHub.
2.  Create a Unity Project where you would like to develop your feature. This
    can be a new or existing project. No one but you will see this project.
3.  Clone or Submodule your fork of the Latios Framework into the Packages
    folder of your project.
4.  If you use a code formatter, format all code in the Latios Framework and
    commit it. (If you know in advance which files you need to modify, you can
    choose to only format those files instead. But make sure you do not commit
    any other formatted files in future commits.)
5.  Make your changes and test using your project.
6.  Make as many commits as you like.
7.  Do not worry about documentation or version numbers. Documentation updates
    are nice, but not necessary. Unity Tests are also optional.
8.  Push your changes to your fork.
9.  Make a pull request.
10. PRs will land in a staging branch. Pay attention to reviews. Some may have
    suggested improvements. However, if such suggestions are trivial, they might
    be made in the next release commit on top of your commits’ changes.

## Developing Without GitHub

If you use some other source control mechanism or an internal git host, follow
these steps:

1.  Create a Unity Project where you would like to develop your feature. This
    can be a new or existing project. No one but you will see this project.
2.  Download, Clone, or Submodule the Latios Framework into the Packages folder
    of your project.
3.  If you use a code formatter, format all the code in the Latios Framework and
    save a copy in a zipped folder.
4.  Make your changes and test using your project.
5.  Do not worry about documentation or version numbers. Documentation updates
    are nice, but not necessary. Unity Tests are also optional.
6.  Save a copy of your changes to a zipped folder.
7.  Send your zipped folder (and the zipped folder from step 3 if you have one)
    via Discord, Unity forums PM, email, or any other contact channel you are
    aware of. The zipped folder should typically be under 2 MB in size (exclude
    documentation in your zip).

Your changes will be cherry-picked into a local development project and included
in the release. You will not be included in git metadata associated with the
changes. I use tools like Meld for merging such changes, in case you were
wondering.

## Naming

My naming conventions are a little bit different from Unity and more closely
resemble my C++ naming convention. You don’t have to follow these when
developing new features. But expect deviations to be modified in an official
release.

-   All data types, enum values, and methods use PascalCase.
-   All fields and properties use camelCase.
-   Private fields and properties have an “m_” prefix.
-   Internal fields and properties may also have an “m_” prefix if they are
    accompanied by public members.
-   ECS tag components have a “Tag” suffix.
-   Zero-size enableable components have a “Flag” suffix.
-   ECS systems have a “System” suffix.

If you have a tendency to be overly bland or generic with your type, variable,
and function names, please use comments to provide details so that I can better
understand your code.

## Formatting

In general, do not worry about formatting. Instead, format the files you intend
to modify first, and then make your changes such that I can see the diff of just
the changes and not your formatting.

I have my own tool for formatting which I use for personal development called
“Alina”. It is not perfect, so if you are interested in helping it be better and
usable by more people, let me know!

## Unit Tests

If you want them, write them. But in general, my philosophy has always been to
test things with real projects. That way, I not only test the code itself, but
also the practicality of such APIs. If you don’t like unit tests, don’t worry
about it.

## The Final Step

Let me know what name you would like to be referred to in the Contributors
section of the README. If you don’t have a preference, I will typically default
to your Unity forums username. If you have a webpage you would like to be linked
to your name, let me know that as well.

## Large Features Notice

When a member of the community contributes a large feature, it may not always be
possible or practical for someone else to fix any bugs related to that feature.
For this reason, large features contributed by the community are often marked as
“experimental” or “addons”. Bugs in such features may not be fixed in regular
patch releases.

With that said, very seldom do people get designs right the first time. Much of
the Latios Framework comes from analyzing previous designs and finding ways to
do things better. Even if your big feature is experimental, it is still valuable
and will help the community learn and grow and eventually do something amazing!

## Consider Open Projects

[Free Parking](https://github.com/Dreaming381/Free-Parking) is an open project
designed as an experimental playground for framework developers, users,
teachers, learners, experimenters, prototypers, tech demo-ers, open-source
enthusiasts, and much more! There, you’ll be able to collaborate quickly with
other developers to help land the features you desire as fast as possible.

For something that is a little less formalized, there is also the Hack-Labs
repository, which is intended to be a contributors-only repository for various
developments.

## My Own Workflow

I manually synchronize development of the Latios Framework across several
projects. This means I often have multiple versions of the framework with
experimental features. Eventually changes are organized in a release repo which
pushes directly to the official repo on GitHub.

If you would like a copy of any experimental version of the framework,
especially if you wish to develop new features against it and make some of the
existing experimental features release-viable, let me know. But don’t expect
that unreleased experimental stuff to not obliterate your nose with awfulness.

## “I’d love to help, but the stuff you do is way over my head!”

You don’t need to develop new features to help out.

If you use the Latios Framework, you can make demo projects which can help
others understand how to use the API. You can send those projects to me via zip
files or send me a public link to the demo.

If you are an artist or designer, you can create assets and send them to me to
be featured in demos, examples, and tutorials.

Also, a huge help for future users is writing devlogs about your adventures with
the Latios Framework. You can even showcase your progress in the Discord! We
love it!

If there is a particular feature that you want, build a sample project where the
feature could easily be leveraged and share it with me. This gives me a concrete
use case to develop the new feature against and ensure it works. Doing this cuts
development time of the feature in half or more!

## Art

If you reached this section because you have disposable income and really,
really want to put it towards the Latios Framework, the best thing you can do is
commission an artist to create assets that can be used for future experiments
and sample projects (yes, this does make feature development go faster because I
can better test the effectiveness of features in more realistic scenarios).
There are plenty of sites out there where you can commission an artist. Pick
whoever you like.

If you are an artist, pretend you were commissioned for whatever amount you like
(or don’t if that messes with your mojo). Assume whatever art is contributed
will be released as CC0 within a year of its creation.

While most art will be useful in some capacity at some point (use common sense),
here’s a living list of ideas that will be especially helpful:

-   Detailed 3D characters
    -   The more detailed, the better, as detail tends to push the tech harder
        and sometimes incentivize the development of new features a detailed
        character could leverage.
-   Character concept art for ATAR
    -   Magical girls, but each character’s magic borrows from different
        cultural folklore, and some are non-magical but skilled at some random
        thing that makes them standout.
-   Hub Worlds for Free Parking
    -   A place that looks nice for lots of different characters to hang out in,
        and a good test for character controllers.
-   Guns
    -   ATAR has FPS gameplay, so guns are a must. But also, guns that aren’t
        necessarily weapons make for great tools for symbolizing interactivity
        in Physics experiments.
-   Terrain
    -   Complex terrain scenes with trees and various LODs can really push the
        boundaries of technology.

If you have further inquiries, PM me on the Unity forums or DM me on Discord.

# Latios Framework Documentation

Welcome! This is the documentation repository for Latios Framework releases.

It would be awesome if this was an actual GitHub pages site with generated API
docs and all, but the dev-ops deities often smite me for breaking too many sound
barriers with my low-level coding skills. If you want to help, take your best
shot at a PR and teach those deities a lesson!

For now, you can navigate this repo and click on any of the markdown files to
get GitHub to render a documentation page for you. If a folder name starts with
a capital letter, it has markdown documentation inside it. If you canâ€™t find an
example or explanation for something you believe is valuable, create an issue or
reach out to me via the various channels!
